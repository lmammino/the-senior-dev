# A senior engineer

<v-clicks>

- The definition changes in every company
- There are many levels of seniority: senior, staff engineer, principal, etc.
- My definition: **moves projects & people forward** (_"Force multiplier"_)
- **Team player**, **not** a hero (or rockstar, superstar, magician, unicorn, etc.)

# How to grow

---

# Go 1 level deeper

- Don't stop at the layer you are familiar with
- What happens in the underlying layers?
- E.g.
  - How does the **HTTP** protocol work?
  - How does **TCP** work?
  - **UTF-8**, **SHA512**, **DNS**, etc.
- [üé• The computer science iceberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H565avw-ufk)
- Discend one level at the time
- Build prototypes

---

# Have fun

- Learning new stuff can be fun
- You can build utilities and side projects
- Showcase what you learned to your peers
- Can you apply these learnings at work?
- Hackaton and free study days are a great way to spend work time for engineering growth


---

# Pair programming

- Try to pair with as many people as possible within the org
- You can probably learn something from everyone (even from the most junior)
- You can probably teach something to everyone (even to the most senior)


---

# Create content

- Articles, Talks, Videos, Twitter threads, Etc.
- You don't need to be an expert to share something new you learned
- Make it a habit
- Creating content will massively improve your communication skills
- [‚öõÔ∏è Atomic essays](https://www.ship30for30.com/post/how-to-write-an-atomic-essay-a-beginners-guide)

---

# Keep a positive attitude

- Be pragmatic when problems arise
- With enough time and money you can probably solve everything
- With _sligthly less_ money and time you can find decent compromises üòÖ
- Help others
  - Especially at the early phases of a project/feature
		- Avoid common design mistakes early on
    - e.g. defining data models for dbs/events and keeping those documented and versioned
	- But don't do the mistake of thinking that there's only one solution
		- Evaluate other proposals, suggest and give people space to experiment and go ahead with other ideas
- Don't be picky about technology or style

We cannot excel at everything


---

But we should know our strengths and weaknesses


---

Work with our team to amplify strenghts and compensate weaknesses

And strive to get better every day!
