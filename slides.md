# A senior engineer

<v-clicks>

- The definition changes in every company
- There are many levels of seniority: senior, staff engineer, principal, etc.
- My definition: **moves projects & people forward** (_"Force multiplier"_)
- **Not** a hero (or rockstar, superstar, magician, unicorn, etc.)

# Tech skills

---

- **T-shaped profile**
  - Master at 1 thing
  - Proficient at many other things
- Broad understanding of the system
  - (architecture, code structure, testing, deployment, scalability)
- Comfortable with different programming languages and paradigms
- Understands technical tradeoffs
  - Eg. Monolith vs Microservices, Memory vs CPU, scalable vs low latency, Reusable vs bespoke, Complex (but powerful) vs Simple (but limited)
  - Can optimizes for the most relevant ones
  - Understands the short vs long term impact of these
- Keeps track of technical debt and helps to pay it back
- Understand best practices
- Can suggest patterns that have good long term effects and avoids other that might lead to problems
- Can solve a problem in different ways and with different tools (adaptable, not one size fits all)


---

# Soft skills

 - Communication!
   - Be able to talk with all the stakeholders
   - Be able to talk about failures and learnings
   - Planning, drive cerimonies
   - Can write docs, deliver presentations
   - Can make complex topics digestable
  - Autonomy
    - Can drive projects that require research and grind
    - But aware of avoiding silos
 - Growth (?)
   - Always learning
   - Always teaching / sharing
 -

## Traits of a Senior Engineer
- T-shaped profile (strong at one thing, understands many things)
- A bridge between product and tech
- Force multiplier (makes other better)
- Mindset of "always-be-learning"
- Soft skills
- Set expectations
	- What does it mean to be successful in the current environment
- Positive attitude:
	- Don't blame the system
	- Propose solutions
	- Facilitate conversations
	- Help to find compromises

---

## Attitude

 - Humble: Know when to say "I don't know"
 - Value collective success over individual performance
 - Keeps the project goal in mind and help to optimise for it (_follow the north star_)
 - Take ownership
 - Knows how to get unstuck (don't just wait idle when facing difficulties)
 - Confidence that hard problems can be solved even if we don't know how yet

---

## Suggestions on how to grow

- Go 1 level deeper!
	- Be curious
	- Dig deeper
	- Ask why
	- Ask how does this work (UTF-8, SHA512, DNS, etc.)
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H565avw-ufk (Computer Science Iceberg)
	- Ask yourself "how would I have implemented this"
- Have fun
- Attitude:
	- Help others, especially at the early phases of a project/feature
		- Your experience might be valuable to avoid common design mistakes early on (e.g. defining data models for dbs/events and keeping those documented and versioned)
	- But don't do the mistake of thinking that there's only one solution
		- Evaluate other proposals, suggest and give people space to experiment and go ahead with other ideas
	- Don't be picky about technology
