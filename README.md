A presentation by Luciano Mammino([@loige](https://twitter.com/loige)) about what it takes to be recognised as a Senior Software Engineer:

The goal of this slides deck is to:

- Discuss what is expected from a **senior software engineer** (skills, mindset, duties)
- Packed with _opinions_ (my own and [m](https://twitter.com/loige/status/1496858958124003331) [o](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucianomammino_what-do-you-expect-from-a-senior-software-activity-6902624647033298944-VXIR/) [re](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30582150))
- For devs **to be inspired**
- For managers to **hire**, **set expectations**, **support**, and **evaluate**
